# Scala---Mutable-Set

A class of objects to represent sets of integers using a linked list. The available set operations are:
* Size of a set |S|
* Contains ∈
* Set equality
* Element removal S \ {e}
* Subset ⊂
* Union ∪
* Intersection ∩
* Map S -> {f(s) : s ∈ S}
* Filter {s : s ∈ S ^ p(s)}

The tasks for this practical can be found in **practical2.pdf**.
